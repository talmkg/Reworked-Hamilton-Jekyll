After 2 weeks I'm back with some news. I've moved to Poland because of political reasons, again, let's hope only for this summer like the times before. Unfortunately I have no motivation to learn new things at all because of all things that are happening in my life right now, also I don't really have space in this apartment - neither friends in this country. It appears to me that the situation won't change in near future & we all will be challenged. Our trust, our faith and our friendships.

Well. There are also good news. I've got sub for the best gym in my area, undoubtedly this will help & improve my mental state (also it's a part of my to-do list from the previous post).


Currently I really don't know what to do, but I'll try to keep you updated (soon).
