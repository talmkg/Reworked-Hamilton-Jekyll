After 2 weeks I'm back with some news. I've moved to Poland because of political reasons again, let's hope only for summer. Unfortunately I have no motivation to learn new things at all because of the all things that are happening in my life at the moment, also I don't really have space in this apartment - neither friends in this country. It appears that the situation won't change in near future & we all will be challenged. Our trust, our faith and our friendships.

Well. There are also good news. I've got sub for the best gym in my area, undoubtedly this will help & improve my mental state (also it's a part of my to-do list from the previous post)

Currently I really don't know what to do, but I'll try to keep you updated (soon).
